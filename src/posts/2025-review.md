- wrote and rewrote tripos.pro a couple times! talked to the department about their goofy DSL for courses and made my first grammar
- worked on a cool choose-your-own-adventure live music thingy for a uni course
- thought deeply about optimal time management. decided it was not worth thinking deeply about
- started working for [iterate.com](https://iterate.com). did some cool agent harness work, met some really smart people
- made [SINAESTHESIA](https://olifog.itch.io/sinaesthesia) and got ROBBED in the uni gamejam .
- went to a football game!

- flew out to SF a couple times for the [YC summer fellowship](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/summer-fellows). met some crazy cool people working on interesting things and met the YC partners which was dope
- built [stardust](https://github.com/olifog/stardust), an embeddable hybrid graph-vector database in c++. got super into the underlying storage engine layer and it served as my first real exposure to systems programming. databases are awesome
- spent a few months at a trading firm in london with some lovely people in a lovely office
- bought an unreasonable number of mtg cards and played one (1) commander game
- went to the cloudflare offices with iterate. started idolizing kenton varda and haven't really got over him.
- went mountain biking in glentress, discovered I don't like mountain biking but I do like glentress

**overall progression and review**:

- I am happier and more content with where I am
- I apply for significantly less stuff now. I've beat out the ambition of narcissism though this fight is an ongoing war
- I am heavier than I was
- I feel far more creatively actualised. every creative act is a large cognitive burden/barrier but it always feels incredibly fulfilling
- I am less sure about long term concrete plans, more sure about mental and personal goals and strategies
- I am a significantly worse student though perhaps this can change???
